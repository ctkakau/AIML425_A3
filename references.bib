	abstract = "Publisher Summary This chapter presents a number of examples of systems that use multirate processing and discusses the way in which system considerations lead to a multirate design. It also highlights specific systems that can be referred to when developing design techniques for multirate filters. The chapter focuses on the parameters that describe FIR filter characteristics and reviews the way in which these parameters interact. It focuses on how the coupling between these parameters affects the design of multirate filters. Starting with classical frequency and time domain specifications of lowpass FIR filters, it presents a number of quick, first-order approximations to the ways they interact. The chapter discusses the way by which data rate reduction is achieved with lowpass FIR filters and demonstrates, via the McClellan–Parks (MP) design algorithm, the way by which the choice of filter parameters controls filter characteristics, and the way by which these parameters can be traded for desirable performance gains. It also examines data rate reduction techniques that use carrier-centered FIR filters and center frequencies with interesting signal processing characteristics. The chapter also reviews simple architectural models of FIR filters and highlights the important FIR filter relationships by graphical presentations.",
